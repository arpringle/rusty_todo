# rusty_todo

`rusty_todo` is a very simple Rust CLI tool for managing a TODO list. It is written in less than 150 lines of code.

It demonstrates competency with many of the core features of Rust, including:
- The ownership system
- Structs
- Enums
- Dervive macros
- The type system
- Data Structures
- Data modeling
- File I/O (synchronous)
- The crate ecosystem
    - Serde for serialization/deserialization
    - clap for command-line parsing

It was designed specifically to be a lightweight and small program to show off my ability to write idiomatic Rust code.
